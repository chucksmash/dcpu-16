## Things I Intentionally Left Out

These are things I left out in the interest of time. I would like to
add them back after I have some nice tests in place:

- Handling for negative numbers
- Labels
- char values
- DAT entries (for null-terminated strings and otherwise)

## Things I Forgot or Missed

These are things I didn't mean to leave out but left out anyway:

- ~~The program counter (PC) A/B value types~~
